## üéØ What Clone Home Does

**Clone Home is for LOCAL repository organization:**

‚úÖ **What it DOES:**

- Downloads/clones your GitHub repositories to your local machine
- Organizes them into custom folder structures locally
- Reads repository information via GitHub API (read-only)
- Creates local `.env` and `.clonehome` configuration files
- Manages your local development environment setup

‚ùå **What it does NOT do:**

- Modify anything on GitHub (repos, settings, etc.)
- Push changes back to GitHub
- Create or delete repositories on GitHub
- Change GitHub repository settings or permissions

**It's simply a smart way to download and organize all your GitHub repos locally.**

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Web Interface (Recommended)

```bash
npm install
npm start web
```

Open `http://localhost:3847` and follow the Setup ‚Üí Organize ‚Üí Clone workflow.

### Command Line

```bash
npm install
npm start setup  # Configure GitHub token and preferences
npm start clone  # Clone all repositories
```

## Installation

**Prerequisites**: Node.js 18.0.0+, Git, GitHub Personal Access Token

```bash
npm install
npm link  # Optional: make CLI globally available
```

## Setup

1. **Create GitHub Personal Access Token** with `repo` and `read:org` scopes
2. **Configure Clone Home**: `npm start setup`

Configuration is stored in `~/.clone-home/config.json`

## üåê Web Interface

Start the web interface: `npm start web` ‚Üí Open `http://localhost:3847`

**Features**: Setup ‚Üí Browse Repositories ‚Üí Organize with Drag & Drop ‚Üí **Export Both .env & .clonehome Files** ‚Üí Clone

**Key Advantage**: The web interface can export **both** configuration file types:

- **`.env` files** with your GitHub token and settings
- **`.clonehome` files** with your repository organization structure

Perfect for setting up new development machines with complete configuration!

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Command Line

Basic commands:

```bash
npm start setup   # Configure GitHub token and preferences
npm start list    # List all repositories
npm start clone   # Clone all repositories
npm start status  # Check local repository status
```

**Advanced**: Use `--filter`, `--dry-run`, and `--force` options for precise control.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.clone-home/config.json`. **The web interface provides dual export capabilities:**

- **`.env` files**: Export your GitHub token and settings for easy project setup
- **`.clonehome` files**: Save and share your repository organization structure

This allows you to quickly set up new development environments with both authentication and folder organization in place.

## Security

- **Read-only operations**: Clone Home only reads from GitHub via API - never writes or modifies
- GitHub tokens are stored locally in the project's `.env` file
- Tokens are never logged or transmitted anywhere except to GitHub's API
- Use tokens with minimal required permissions (`repo` and `read:org` scopes only)
- All operations are local to your machine - nothing is sent back to GitHub
